# Path finding visualizers
 Here are some path finding visualizers created with Processing 3

## General information
Each folder contains a visualizer that implements a specific *Uninformed Search Algorithm*

1. Uniform-cost search algorithm
2. Breadth-first search algorithm
3. Depth-first search algorithm


## Exemple

Here is an exemple of a path visualization using Breadth-first search algorithm

* The red block represents the starting node (it can be moved using keybord arrows)
* The green block represents the targeted node.
* The path in yellow represents one of the shortest possible paths (except for Depth-first search algorithm which may not generate the shortest path).
* Orange blocks are the visited nodes.
